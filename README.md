# SSBM_Image_Processing
MATLAB code to process videos of SSBM. It finds and interprets the percents the players are at at each frame, the time of the stage, and what stage are they playing in.

Was my first attempts at messing with computer vision, not quite useful now with how good a DL approach would work on a problem like this.
