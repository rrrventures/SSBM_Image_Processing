# SSBM_Image_Processing
MATLAB code to process videos of SSBM. It finds and interprets the percents the players are at at each frame, the time of the stage, and what stage are they playing in.

Check out the MAINSCRIPT first, and then branch out to the other functions.

You can also check out some blog post I made to get a better overview of this whole thing: https://rrrventures.wordpress.com/2016/05/17/ssbm-image-processing-part-1-stage-time/

Work in progress.
